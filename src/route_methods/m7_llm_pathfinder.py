"""
src/route_methods/m7_llm_pathfinder.py - Neuro-Symbolic Topological Lattice (NSTL)

M7: LLM Full-Context Pathfinder.

Unlike M4 (one cell at a time, from a 5-candidate shortlist, names only) and
M5 (a same-shape one-shot call, names only, tried only as a last resort),
M7 gives the model the full prompt AND the full RAG-retrieved candidate set
WITH each cell's real input/output type signature, in one call, and asks it
to reason out the entire ordered path itself -- the way a human engineer
reading the node list would. The embedder still does the retrieval (the
`tunnel` argument, already narrowed by LatticeRouter.route()); the LLM is
the one deciding how those retrieved nodes chain together to satisfy the
prompt. Nothing here is domain-specific: the candidate list, and every
op/type name in it, comes entirely from whatever trees are loaded.

The proposed order is never trusted blindly -- each consecutive pair is
re-verified with the same Robinson-unification machinery (step_unifies /
find_bridge) every other route method already uses, and a 1-step bridge
cell is inserted automatically where the model's ordering has a type gap
it didn't (or couldn't) resolve itself.

Falls back to M1 (clause-anchor) when no LLM is loaded, the model's output
doesn't parse, or none of the proposed cell IDs are in the shown candidate
set.
